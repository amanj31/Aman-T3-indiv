* In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state. An imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform to achieve a result. Imperative programming focuses on describing "how" a program code works.
* Object Oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects. It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), which are used to create individual instances of objects.
