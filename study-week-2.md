The answer is I only (A) because in A, 2 is cast to double since there are no parentheses. This makes the division become floating point, not integer. II and III cast (2/4) or (2/4 + 3) to double, but these already are evaluated as 3 first.

I and III are wrong because they casues a NullPointerException. On the other hand, II correctly checks if borrower is null, so B is the answer.
